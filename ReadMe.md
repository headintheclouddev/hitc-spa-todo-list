# HITC NetSuite Todo List SPA

## Summary
This NetSuite Single Page Application (SPA) is based loosely on "Learn React Hooks" chapter 12 - Todo List Redux.
The walkthrough video for this project is here: (coming in April 2025)

## SPA Lessons learned:
1. Always (as much as possible) use UIF components rather than standard HTML elements.
2. Even though there are simpler state-management options, life will be easier if you give in and do things in the UIF Redux way.
   In other words, your app is more likely to work and you'll have fewer headaches if you take the time to use Redux.
